========= ChangeLog: =========

ver 0.0.4 - The Anime Highway
	49.) Time to upload to github. I guess it's been pleanty long working on it since updating github last.
	48.) Got both VideoWeed and NovaMov to be playable again.
	47.) Fixed little problem with the download option for video44
	46.) Added Video Source Runday list to the ChangeLog file, to better keep people uptodate on whats working.
	45.) DailyMotion Videos >> Play: working , Downloads: no
	44.) Working on resorting out my main method for Video Link fetching.
	43.) It's After 5am... Zzz... (Time to sleep.)
	42.) Added File not found to another of the sources.
	41.) Added Part # labeling for VideoFun and Video44.
	40.) Stuck on dailymotion and NovaMov.
	39.) Sorted out most of the common Video Sources. NovaMov for sure is messed up atm, but VideoFun, Video44, YourUpload, VideoWeed, & VidZur seem to be working now.
	38.) Doing a MAJOR overhaul to fix the messup that led to sloppy coding in process of filtering the Video Source types.
	37.) Noticed a problem of using 'match[0]' instead of 'url' in some place(s).
	36.) Done some fixes for YourUpload source. Hoping it will work for downloading a lot more often now. Screenshot should also work more often now.
	35.) VidZur(noticed on anime44 and animeget) source seems to work finally. Download for VidZur also seems to work fine.
	34.) Added graphic for VidZur.
	33.) Working on adding VidZur as a source location.
	32.) Added [COLOR tan] [/COLOR] to Favorites and Highway in many places thru-out the plugin.
	31.) Left the ability to block download feature in Function() but setup an if-statement to block them by string-in-URL statements for the known bad sources.
	30.) I have dissabled video downloads for 2ndary Links of VideoFun sources. You can still use getURL feature on these.
	29.) More Download Notes:
					# Let me take this moment to point out that there's not currently a Cancel feature for the downloads. Hmm, then again, it may or may not cancel but take a short bit before canceling and then not meantoin that its been canceled for the time being.
					# Progress bar does not work atm, or at least on the videos.
					# Filesize is currently in bytes.
					# Some Video Sources like to download in real-time, causing for a very slow agronising wait... while unable to do anything else.
					# Disclaimer: WARNING! If you choose a very laggy download that takes forever, you may very well to forcibly close XBMC and start it again. << You were warned here! This is why it helps to read a change log. >> hehehe.
					# Some video sources end up basically routing to the same bad source types at times while not at other times. This made a lot of my testing somewhat meaningless... but I still made some use of the information.
					# More testing needs done on this feature.
					# 
	28.) Testing of Download on the differant Video Sources:																																							#									# [##] = random data for the most part.
					# VideoFun:  			# (failure)		# Does not seem possible at this time.																												#Screenshot: yes	# urls: http://[##].videofun.me/videos/[showname]/[filename].flv?st=[##]-[##]&e=[##]
					# Video44:  			# (pass)			# Fast Speed. Complete Video. Good Video Output. Around 37-38mb for 23min videos. 						#Screenshot: no 	# urls: http://[##.##.##.## ip address]/dl/[##]/[##]/[filename].flv
					# NovaMov:  			# (maybe)			# Slow Speed. Seems like real time. May not output a full video.															#Screenshot: no 	# urls: http://[##.##.##.## ip address]/dl/[##]/[##]/[filename].flv
					# YourUpload:  		# (pass)			# Fast Speed. Complete Video. Good Video Output. Around 37-38mb for 23min videos. 						#Screenshot: yes	# urls: http://stream.vidcache.net/[##]?client_file_id=[##]
					# VideoWeed:			#	(failure)		#	Slow Speed.	Seems like real time. Taken longer than real-time to finish downloading.				#Screenshot: no 	# urls: http://[##].videoweed.es/dl/[##]/[##]/[##].flv
					# DailyMotion:		#	(untested)	# 
					# GoogleVideo:		#	(untested)	# 
					# 
	27.) Added Filesize prompt at download completion, to help confirm a good download.
	26.) Problems with the ContextMenuItem display options have led to skipping the easy function for the time being, or atleast for True/False options. Those options seem to work now.
	25.) Added Clear-Favorites option to the Plugin category in settings window.
	24.) ContextMenuItem > Downloading, Show URL >> settings should now work.
	23.) Have noticed that some video sources dont want to work for downlaods and will DL a second or two basically and stop. << For now, try a differant source when possible.
	22.) Yes/No-Dialog > Figured out how to set text in place of Yes and No, so I setup a Movie / Shows folder prompt. This means Movies folder now works too. So, you now have the option of saving to your settable movie or show folder.
	21.) Folder settings now gotten for Shows Folder.
	20.) Progress-Dialog for file download doesn't seem to show any progress increasing, but atleast this way you better know when the file download has started and ends besides the little notice prompts that doesnt last long.  Wish I could get something going in the upper right hand corner as I've seen with another addon before, but I simply dont know how yet.
	19.) Working on Dialogs again today.
	18.) Researched addon settings getting.
	17.) Got bored of WoW super-fast.
	16.) Is a Taco Tuesday at one of our town's local gas station, so I caught a bite to eat and played some WoW on Astralwow.info to take a bit of a break from working on the plugin non-stop.
	15.) Settigns > Account				>> Username, Password, Use Account? << I should meantion that this may never be integrated, but wanted it setup just in case.
	14.) Settings > Plugin 				>> Download master branch file (downloads the .zip as a .avi, so will need to change that manually for now)
	13.) Settings > Downloads 		>> ContextMenuItem >>> File Downloading, Show URL
	13.) Settings > Downloads 		>> Show Folder, Movie Folder
	12.) Added Language file (/language/english/strings.xml)
	11.) Working on the plugin's Settings window. Mainly Prep work for now. None of the Settings are currently used at this point.
	10.) --File Downloading-- (preset local path)
	09.) Yes/No-Dialogs
	08.) OK-Dialogs
	07.) Testing File Downloading.
	06.) Had ShowPage URLs setup for keyboard method, Now got it setup for Video URLs too. Still no copy/paste yet.
	05.) Setup Keyboard method to display -some- URLs, but not sure how to setup copy/paste yet.
	04.) Trying to put together a method to display URLs for easier copy/paste.
	03.) I saw one DailyMotion link earlier I beleive that showed as error (non-playable). Can't seem to remember which show/episode it was on now to work on fixing that just yet.
	02.) Fixed up Show-Poster graphic, current Fanart, and Show name (without date-stamp) to carry through from show listings to link listings and even display while video is playing. This way if there's no screenshot for a given video-source, it'll default to the Show-Poster graphic. I've been trying to away from annoying huge images showing as the icon on the play-bar during watching videos... but this seems to look better than seeing the video source site's name.
	01.) liz.addContextMenuItems(contextMenuItems, replaceItems=True)##replaceItems is now set to False, so that shows can still be set to XBMC Overall-Favorites List and such things.

ver 0.0.3c - The Anime Highway
	14.) Fixed Favorites to work when clicked to view the show's episodes  propperly.
	13.) Show/Add/Remove/Clear-Favorites seem to all be functioning now.
	12.) Added Clear-Favorites ContextMenuItem to empty list of Favorites.
	11.) Adding more data to be recorded for Add/Remove-Favorites... I should really see about fixing this method later.
	10.) Show-Favorites seem to be working but now more probs with Add/Remove-Favorites.
	09.) Add/Remove-Favorite seem to work but Favorites not showing up in Favorites Menu.
	08.) Add-Favorite...somewhat functional.
	07.) Sorted out issues I hadn't noticed with my notification method.
	06.) Decided to use what seems to be a more common method for ContextMenuItem execusion of commands.
	05.) Getting more used to using "%s - %s" % (item1,item2) type method of doing things.
	04.) Hours spent figuring out issues wit hsetting up functions and such to run from the ContextMenuItems.
	03.) Researched ContextMenuItems Methods.
	02.) Started work on researching methods used by others for Saving Favorites within the plugin.
	01.) ...hours sorting out stuff to setup things on github.

ver 0.0.3 - The Anime Highway
	11.) GoogleVideo icon graphic added.
	10.) Thinking of watching some more of the anime series Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru! (episode 2)... to take a break.
	09.) There aren't many Google Video links either, so I haven't hunted up one yet to try and make sure they work finally, yet. I added a simular method as to what I did for the others... so there's a slight chance they may work.
	08.) There aren't many DailyMotion links, so I haven't hunted up one to double check hat they still work... nor rather they work most or just some of the time.
	07.) NovaMov video source urls now seem to be working.
	06.) VideoFun video source urls now seem to be working. <<< This is a HUGE help for those wanting to watch any of the Anime Movies.
	05.) NovaMov icon graphic added.
	04.) VideoFun icon graphic added.
	03.) YourUpload icon graphic added.
	02.) 2ndary method made for YourUpload videos, as only some wanted to work before. Now, most should work.
	01.) Testing on other video source urls for AddLink().

ver 0.0.2d - The Anime Highway (named after myself)
	03.) Added plugin graphics for GoodDrama.
	02.) Hopefully fixed the new path issue I was having.
	01.) Setting up new project path became troublesome.

ver 0.0.2b - The Anime Highway (named after myself)
	15.) OK decided on The Anime Highway (Anime Highway on the list to be more to the top of the A's) as it sounds better than Animation Highway.
	14.) Sorting extra files out for Release Time, and considering plugin's new name.
	13.) Genres (with/without count), Show/Movie Listings, Episode Listings (with/without date stamp) seem to be working. Video-Source URL Links still seem to be troublesome for some yourupload links and I havent had the chance to get others any further positive progress for now.
	12.) Realized I had a bug on the genre's page which turned out to be a forgoten elif(elseif) in the site-change handling area for the whole plugin. This caused wrong data to show for animeplus and gooddrama, but is now fixed.
	11.) Added GooddDama.net to the plugin.
	10.) Fixed some urls I forget about for AnimeGet
	09.) Added AnimePlus.tv to the plugin.

	07.) Fixed animeget side of plugin to do the additional menu choices.
	06.) Added icon and fanart graphics for overall plugin project.
	05.) Setup for additional icon and fanart graphics.
	04.) Added modifications for more colored text.
	03.) Added Site selection menu.
	02.) Settup of further arrays.
	01.) Filtering in data for both sites.

ver 0.0.2a - Anime44
	07.) I've Decided to merge my AnimeGet and Anime44 plugins to make one named Animation Highway.
	06.) Got my first YourUpload video source link to work finally. (4th video source seems to be working.)
	05.) Added colored Text to video source links.
	04.) Added colored Text to keep some differance between movies (red) and series (blue).
	03.) Added some arrays and better handling to easy shift between projects.
	02.) Annoyed by the tab-spacing issues with Python scripting.
	01.) Working towards cleaning up the mess of extra imports.

ver 0.0.1b - Anime44 - [Released]
	06.) My icon and fanart images for me havent wanted to update propperly, but hopefully they'll show up right for you instead of showing the old animeget graphics.
	05.) More or less, a bunch of little fixes, tweaks and hadling the change over for Anime44 from the original plugin for AnimeGet, which i still plan to work on.
	04.) Made Fix for lack of date stamp on episode list.
	03.) Made Fixes for Movie Listings.
	02.) Fix things up a bit to make it easier to change for other simular sites later on.
	01.) Movies seem to get the royal shaft on this site. No Art, no categories, just one long list on a single page. Anime Shows seems to have a slight few less options too, but not as badly downgraded.

ver 0.0.1a - AnimeGet - [Released]
	12.) Noticed some simular sites and looking at them for possible expansion. For the time being, I'm going to copy my addon and see about fixing it up to work on one or more other simular sites as well.
	11.) Still searching the site to notice other video sources, but it pretty much means viewing source for each and every page and looking down through it to see. It's very tedious and boring, so will wait a while on that. Currently 3 video sources work. Unfortunately 1 important one does seem to be quite secure and thus does not (videofun.me).
	10.) Things seem to be working for top choices: movies, shows, ongoing, new, surprise-me. Have not bothered to do Latest episodes or Search feature yet. That might wait to way down the line. (feel free to edit it to add them if you wish)
	09.) Setting up additional Top-menu choices. Still a few unavailable.
	08.) Added Source for DailyMotion.
	07.) Visited the #xbmchub IRC chat channel again to see how things were, thanked o9r1sh, said hello to TwistedZero.
	06.) Setting up Genres for menu.
	05.) Found fix for parsing of video sources (video44 and videoweed) thanks to o9r1sh of plugin.video.gogoanime.
	04.) Setting up alphabetical index.
	03.) Setting up main menu.
	02.) Testing to make sure atleast some of the video sources will work with Addlink().
	01.) Sorting out the basic foundation of the video plugin(s).
